There's a long-standing bug where your syntax highlighint / intellisense isn't working.

To fix, make sure you have the Godot Support extension installed.

Next, make sure you are in Solution View (not folder view).

Finally, created a CS file in the ProjectMatchstick.Game folder. This should "wake up" intellisense.
